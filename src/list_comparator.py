The following requires knowledge of the mathematical field of "List Theory" - which you will not have, as I've
just invented it!

List Theory: The study of unsorted groups that allow duplicates (because the hell with Set Theory...)
Here are some initial definitions:
- When two or more lists are compared, they exist on the same "level".
- Any element that appears on all lists at the level is called a "horizon".

Operators of list theory:
A.  Annihilation

    "{A, B, B, C} annihilate {A, B, D}"
    - Each operand (list) is called a "nihilant"
    - From all lists at the level, the shortest list is called the "key nihilant"
    Result: {B, C} and {D}
    (All horizons are removed)

    To reiterate: Duplicates in a list are not removed, unless there's a horizon to annihilate them:
    {B, B, B} annihilate {B, B}
    Result: {B} and {}

    1.  First law of Annihilation:
        "The maximum number of horizons is equal to the number of members of the key nihilant" (Nobel prize in
        mathematics if you prove it! ðŸ˜ƒ )

/* I ported this from my work in Java. I did not like any of the Collections available, nor am I a fan of streaming
relatively small objects. I am pretty sure Python has something more suitable but I resorted to what I know */
